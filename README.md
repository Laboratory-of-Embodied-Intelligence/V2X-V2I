# Overview
This project aims at implementing and optimizing a particular scenario for autonomous cars in an V2I environment. We provide the code and blueprints for a benchmark comparison between systems where most computations are done by an infrastructure (IS) rather than vehicles (V) and vice versa.

## Scenario
3 DuckieBots (DB) are coming to a T-Crossroad (TC) from each of the three lanes. All DBs need to follow their trajectory which may or not involve switching lanes without stopping nor colliding with another DB.
Each can have different speed and different starting points.

## Topics

-Speed control

-Prioritization

-Computation delegation
